# Pong-Typescript
Easy to understand implementation of the classic arcade game pong. Useful learning tool for Typescript or OOP beginners.

## Getting started
To play the game simple open the `index.html` file inside of the `dist` folder. Currently the game only offers a single player experience versus an AI. Future updates will add multiplayer and AI vs AI.

## Compiling to project
To compile the project you will need to have `node` installed. First install the project's dependencies through your package manager of choice.

``$ yarn install `` or ``$ npm install ``

Next make a change to the project. The best place to start is by modifying some variables in `Constants.ts` such as the colours and the speed of the ball. Once a change has been made the Typescript code can be compiled into JavaScript. To do this run the following command `npm run compile` or `yarn run compile`.

Once you've got that working, why not try adding a new feature? Pull requests are very welcome! :-)
